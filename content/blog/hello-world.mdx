# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post using MDX, which allows me to write content in Markdown while also using React components when needed.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a powerful format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. This means you can:

- Write content in Markdown
- Use React components
- Import and use other MDX files
- Add interactive elements

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```typescript
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World')); // Output: Hello, World!
```

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

1. Software Development
2. Web Technologies
3. Best Practices
4. Personal Projects

Stay tuned for more content!
